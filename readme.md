## What is a program
- A program is a set of instructions instructing a computer to do specific tasks.
- "Software" is a generic term used to describe computer program.
### The software can be categorized in three categories
- System software includes device drivers, operating system, etc. It serves as a base for application software
- Programming software is a set of tools to aid developers in writing programs.
- Application software is intended to perform a certain tasks.
## Programming Languages
- A programming language is a computer language engineered to communicate instructions to a machine.
## Machine Language
- Machine language is a low-level computer language that is designed to be directly understandable by a computer and it is the language into which all programs must be converted before they can run 
## Assembly Language
- Assembly language replaces the instructions represented by patterns 0f 0's and 1's with alphanumeric symbols called as mnemonics in order to make it easier to remember and work with them including reducing the chances of making errors
## High-Level Language
- High-level languages are written in a form that is close to our human language, enabling programmers to focus on the problem being solved. High-level languages are platform independent which means that the programs written in a high-level language can be executed on different types of machines.
- A program written in a high-level language is called a source code and is a collection of human-readable computer instructions.
- A compiler is a system software program that transform high-level source code written by a software developer in a high-level programming language to a low-level machine language the process is known as compilation.
- Not all the source code is compiled. With some programming languages like Python, Ruby and Perl the source code is frequently executed directly using an interpreter rather than first compiling it then executing the resulting machine language.
### Programming Paradigm
- Imperative programming is a paradigm of computer programming in which the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer as one is executed in turn.
- Logical The idea in logical programming is that instead of telling the computer how to calculate things you tell it what things are E.g PROLOG
- Functional In functional programming language, functions are treated as first-class objects.
- Object-Oriented is used to describe a programming approach based on objects and classes. The object-oriented paradigm allow us to organize software as a collection of objects that consist of both data and behaviour. 
## Software Development
- Software development is a process by which stand-alone or individual software is created using a specific programming language. It involves writing a series of interrelated programming code, which provides  the functionality of developed software.
- The process of software development goes through a series of stages in stepwise fashion known as the Software Development Life Cycle
- Planning
- Analysis and Requirement Gathering
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance
